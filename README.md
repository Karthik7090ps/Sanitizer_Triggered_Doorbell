# Sanitizer_Triggered_Doorbell
 Sanitizer-Triggered Doorbell : This project uses an alcohol sensor to detect hand sanitizer application. When sanitizer is detected near the alcohol sensor, it triggers a relay to ring a doorbell. An innovative approach promoting hygiene, ensuring the doorbell only rings when sanitizer is used.
